- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rhythik
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, data science, cryptography, and various blockchain technology applications. While not directly related to github related topics, I am also quite passionate about audio engineering, audio production, and the arts in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mainly Python and HTML at this time while also dabbling a bit with other languages like JS, C, and C++, etc in an attempt to maintain a more beneficial frame of reference for my long-term coding journey. Despite growing up with a computer in front my face I am very new to actually coding and programming. Very excited to finally get around to diving in to all of this!  (Started actually learning to code June 2021)
- 💞️ I’m currently aspiring to eventually collaborate with the Cardano Foundation or another similar organization, but by the time I'm skilled and knowledgable enough to do this quite some years will have likely passed and this aspiration will quite possibly have shifted to something else! But this it the lofty target for now!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
